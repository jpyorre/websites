I'm currently taking several feeds of phishing and malicious URLs and looking at the URI patterns to find trends. I'm categorizing brands and other interesting patterns as well. All this data is being pushed to an elastic search database, where further analysis can be conducted.
At the moment, it's all just exploration. The end goal is to provide centralized threat research information from multiple and different sources of data in one unified format, which can be used by others for their research.

Hopefully, this will also help in attempting to predict where that next phish might be coming from.

Here's a preview of some of a dashboard from the initial testing:
