I presented on automating threat intelligence yesterday at [QuBit](https://sofia.qubitconference.com/) in Sofia, Bulgaria.

This was my first time giving this presenation, and as usual (for me), I was coding up to the moment I walked on stage. I thought it went really well and learned a lot from the audience. What I learned will feed back into additional research on my attempt to automate myself out of a job!

If interested in my code and slides, they can be found in the [Research and Presentations](/pages/research-and-presentations.html) section.
